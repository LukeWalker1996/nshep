###
NSHEP (National Student Housing Excellence Partnership) is a group founded on promoting best practice within student accommodation in the UK.

We house over 15,000 students in the UK in a combination of HMO (House of Multiple Occupancy) properties and PBSA (Purpose Built Student Accommodation) developments either as Landlords, Developers, Investors or Property Managers.

Founded in 2013, NSHEP members meet on a regular basis to discuss improving standards within the student accommodation market with the intention of being continued market leaders.

All members of NSHEP have been selected due to being market leaders in their location or expertise and sharing transparent and collaborative values.
