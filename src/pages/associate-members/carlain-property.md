  Carlain PropertyÂ® is a family business. We specialise in renting  top quality
  homes to students.  Our houses are in central locations, conveniently close to
  college campuses.


  Tenants' satisfaction in our objective. Often new tenants are introduced by
  existing tenants though we attend the University of Gloucestershire Students'
  Union Freshers Fayre every year where visitors to our stand can register to be
  sent our availability list each autumn.


  We own and manage our houses so we take a personal interest in keeping our
  tenants happy. 


  Prompt and efficient maintenance is important and we professionally clean all
  of our houses during the summer changeover. An excellent and friendly support
  team provide a rapid response when needed and includes Builders, Locksmith,
  Electrician, Plumber, Gas Engineer and Gardener. 




  Then there is the annual party for our tenants!
