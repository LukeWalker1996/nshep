  Patrick and Greg created Purple Frog in 2007  while they were studying at the
  University of Birmingham.


  "We were certain we could change student accommodation for the better and
  provide the service that tenants and landlords deserved.


  We started Purple Frog to work around students’ needs. That meant the right
  properties, the right opening times, arranging viewings around you and giving
  a proper level of service", says Patrick.


  Now as sole owner and Managing Director, Patrick believes everything is built
  around giving students what they want. And that’s how the business thrives.


  We want to attract good landlords with great property. To do this we also work
  to their needs and create the service they want.


  Equally for PBSA owners and investors we create best service and make a real
  difference. We do this by working around the students and partners we serve.


  By doing this we make student living easier. We tailor our service to every
  individual, and we strive to be the best, every single day.
